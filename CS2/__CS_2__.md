## [buybinds.cfg](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/blob/main/CS2/buybinds_CS2.cfg)
This config file binds all avaible slots of your loadout to specific keys. I myself use the numpad and its surroundings here. To change keybinds simply change the [key] in each line to your desired one.
### Usage
```css
bind [KEY] "buy [item]";
```
For multiple items on one key simply do:

```css
bind [KEY] "buy [item1]; buy [item2]; ...";
```
Yet note that upon changing the keybinds my *echo* loses its correctness.
