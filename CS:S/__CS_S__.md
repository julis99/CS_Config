As in the other games this config binds the numpad and its surroundings to buy equipment.

## config.cfg
This is a default .cfg, yet it saves all keybinds, the crosshair, the spray, etc.. It can be seen as the config_CSS.cfg, yet autogenerated. The main feature here are my crosshair and
```css
bind mouse4 "r_cleardecals";
```
which binds mouse4 to remove decals (such as blood stains, bullet holes, ...).
