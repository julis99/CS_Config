# Counter Strike Config Files
In this [repository](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config) are my custom self written Counterstrike .cfg files. One can use them by his own at own risk.

## Counter Strike: Source
Even for this game I feature .cfg files, the most useful buybinds.cfg

## [Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/blob/main/CS%3AGO/__CS_GO__.md)
This game might not be playable anymore, still I have kept my .cfg files in which I put some time.

## [Counter Strike 2](CS2/__CS_2__.md)
For the new star on the CS horizon I already have some .cfg files, yet as some commands from CS:GO are still missing I still have them under development
