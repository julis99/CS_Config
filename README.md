# Counter Strike Config Files
In this [repository](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config) are my custom self written Counterstrike .cfg files. One can use them by his own at own risk.

### Counter Strike: Source
Even for this game I feature .cfg files, the most useful buybinds.cfg

### Counter Strike: Global Offensive
This game might not be playable anymore, still I have kept my .cfg files in which I put some time.

### Counter Strike 2
For the new star on the CS horizon I already have some .cfg files, yet as some commands from CS:GO are still missing I still have them under development
