# Counter Strike Config Files

In this [repository](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config) are my custom self written Counterstrike .cfg files. One can use them by his own at own risk.

## [Counter Strike: Source](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/blob/main/CS%3AS/__CS_S__.md)

Even for this game I feature .cfg files, the most useful buybinds.cfg

## [Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/blob/main/CS:GO/__CS_GO__.md)

This game might not be playable anymore, still I have kept my .cfg files in which I put some time.

## [Counter Strike 2](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/blob/main/CS2/__CS_2__.md)

For the new star on the CS horizon I already have some .cfg files, yet as some commands from CS:GO are still missing I still have them under development
This config_CS2.cfg is expanding with every update, at least those scripts are untouched by valve.  
  
To use my exact config just look at the latest [release](https://github.com/julis99/CS_Config/releases) and copy all .cfg files (not the "source code") to your CS2 directory, into the path
```path
%BROWSE_LOCAL_FILES%/game/csgo/cfg 
```
Then simply type ```exec config_CS2``` into the console or add ```+exec config_CS2``` to your CS2 [Launch Options](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_line_options) which
will run the config_CS2 everytime you boot up Counter Strike
